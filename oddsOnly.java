/**
Consider the following incomplete method definition.

public String oddsOnly(String original) {

}
original can be a valid String of unknown length, but might also be empty or null. Your method needs to account for each of these possibilities. The method should combine the odd-numbered characters of original and return the newly created String. If the String is null, return null.
